            <p>We asked ourselves what motivates us to be here. Here are the most common reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Understand policymaking</strong>, and learn about its actors and outcomes</li>
              <li>Work in an <strong>international environment</strong> and meet like-minded people</li>
              <li>The opportunity to <strong>make a difference</strong> and shape the future by contributing to a concrete project</li>
              <li>The belief that <strong>policymaking should be more collaborative and inclusive</strong>, and commitment  to increasing awareness and closing the knowledge gap</li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Policy Analysis</h3>
              <p>We are in a stage of creating content for the tool by analysing and coding major policies in energy, climate and youth for several European countries, plus the EU. Until September, we are focusing on energy, climate and youth policies in place in the European Union, Portugal, Germany, Slovenia and Italy. We are also researching the main institutions involved for each case, and their role in the process. Finally, we wish to follow the evolution of a specific policy strategy, to fully understand its chronology and the process behind it, and to present it in an interactive way.</p>
